# Todolist App

This project is a simple Todolist application that includes both a **React frontend** and a **Spring Boot backend**. The frontend is responsible for the user interface, while the backend handles the API logic and database operations.

## **Project Structure**

The project consists of two main parts:

1. **Backend**: Spring Boot application for managing the todolist.
2. **Frontend**: React application for the user interface.

Both parts are located in the same repository, under separate directories:

- `/To-Do-List` – Contains the Spring Boot backend.
- `/todolist` – Contains the React frontend.
